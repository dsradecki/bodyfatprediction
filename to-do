- remove outliers using boxplots
- remove variables not correlated to the response variable
- implement least squares for matrix form, i.e. solving normal equations
- research question: how additional predictor variables (in addition to the density) might increase the prediction score in body fat
- do multicollinearity tests
- perform PCA for weight and correlated variables in order to see how different attributes might help in prediction (otherwise it is not possible
  to calculate significance because we deal with multicollinearity)
- cross validation for evaluation
